# Configuration Guide

This guide covers the configuration options available for the CVE Dashboard application.

## Configuration File

The main configuration file is `config.sh` located at the root of the project. This file contains various settings and variables that control the behavior of the application.

### Environment Variables

- `EXPORTER_DATA_DIR`: Specifies the directory where vulnerability scan results are stored.
- `SCAN_INTERVAL`: Determines the interval (in seconds) at which vulnerability scans are performed.
- `DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE`: Specifies the path to the Docker Compose file used for running the application.

### Scan Modes

The `scan-script.sh` file includes two modes for running vulnerability scans:

1. **One-time scan**: Performs a single vulnerability scan and then starts the Docker Compose services.
2. **Cron-like mode**: Continuously performs vulnerability scans at the specified `SCAN_INTERVAL`. (default is 30 minutes)

You can select the desired mode by running the `scan-script.sh` script and following the prompts.

## Docker Compose and Dockerfiles

Further customization can be achieved by modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file and the individual Dockerfiles for each component.

- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the services that make up the application, including the vulnerability scanner, data exporter, Prometheus, and Grafana. Adjust settings such as ports, volumes, and environment variables within this file.
- Dockerfiles: Located in the respective component directories, these files specify the build instructions and dependencies for each service. Modify them to include additional packages, change base images, or customize the build process.

## Additional Configuration

While the provided configuration options cover the essential aspects of the application, you may encounter the need for further customization. In such cases, refer to the project documentation or seek assistance from the support team for guidance on advanced configuration techniques or specific requirements.

Remember to exercise caution when modifying configuration files, as incorrect changes can potentially impact the application's functionality or introduce security vulnerabilities.
